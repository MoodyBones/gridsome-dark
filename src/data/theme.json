        "What did you do before you learnt to code?",
        "I have many years experience working in Customer Service, my first job was at McDonalds aged 15 :P! I spent many years climbing the fashion retail ladder, I loved working and managing teams, but fast fashion didn't make me happy. So I did some travelling and plenty of soul searching, and I have been working as noble bar lady."

        "How long have you been coding? and why did you start?",
        "I started coding in high school, and continued for a year after graduation. But then I left to pursue fashion & customer Service. Late in 2018 I was having a conversation with a friend about the lack of diversity in Tech, and I thought hey I should try coding again. I did and immediately fell back in love. I've studying Frontend Development every since, close to 2 years now!"

I love animations, I used to make flash animations back in the day and would love to spend some more time studying web animations and performance. And I love Vuejs and their community, I'm teaching myself Vue 3 right now"
